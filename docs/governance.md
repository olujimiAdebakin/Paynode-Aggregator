# ðŸ§­ Paynode Governance Model (Draft)

Paynode will evolve into a decentralized protocol governed by its network participants.

## Participants
- **Providers:** Supply liquidity and earn protocol fees.  
- **Users:** Access best rates via unified API.  
- **Delegates:** Vote on upgrades, routing parameters, and fee structure.

## Governance Phases

1. **Phase 1:** Core Team Governance (MVP stage).  
2. **Phase 2:** DAO-style Provider Council.  
3. **Phase 3:** Full On-chain Governance via smart contracts.

## Protocol Parameters
- Base fee (0.3â€“0.5%)  
- AI routing model weights  
- Treasury allocations  
- Provider reputation weighting

Governance changes will be enforced through the on-chain configuration contract.
